The Online Food Delivery System is a digital platform that allows customers to order food from different restaurants using a website or mobile app. 
Through this system, customers can create an account, browse restaurants, view menus, select items, place orders, and make secure online payments. After an order is placed, the restaurant receives the details and starts preparing the food. 
A delivery rider is then assigned to pick up the order and deliver it to the customer’s address. 
The system also provides real-time order tracking so customers can see the status of their order, such as when it is being prepared, when the rider picks it up, and when it is on the way. T
he payment gateway handles all online transactions safely and confirms payment status to both the customer and the restaurant. Overall, this system makes food ordering fast, easy, and convenient by connecting customers, restaurants, and delivery riders in one online platform.
